Exceptions – handling and writing
 Programming Projects:
 1) ArrayCounter class
 • Start Eclipse and create a new Java project called ‘exc_lab’
 • Create class called ArrayProcessor
 • Add a method with the following signature
int getArrayLength(Object [] a)
 • Now implement this method, so that it returns the size of the
array. However rather than simply using a.length use a loop
which iterates over each element until an exception is thrown.
 • Deal with that exception within the method, and use this as
the loop terminator.
 • Start with this code
int count = 0;
 while (true) {
 Object t
 count++;
 }
 = a[count];
 • Write a Driver class which creates an instance of
ArrayProcessor then calls the getArrayLength() in order to
test. e.g.
 ArrayProcessor ap = new ArrayProcessor();
 int len = ap.getArrayLength(new String[] {"one", "two", "three"});
 System.out.println(“Array length is “ +len);
 • Why would writing such code not be an appropriate use of the
exception handling mechanism?
2) Menu and InvalidOption exceptions
 • Create class called Menu, but do not add any methods.
 • Now create a class called InvalidOptionException which
‘extends’ the Exception class.
 • Within the Menu class add a method which allows a selected
menu option to be displayed, the signature should be
void displayMenuOption(int opt) throws InvalidOptionException;
 • Implement the method so it accepts options 1 to 3 only, and
outputs a message such as “Menu option 1 selected”.
 • If the passed opt parameter is outside the accepted range then
update the method so that it throws an InvalidOptionException
 • Extend the Driver class from question 1, so that it creates an
instance of the Menu class and does several calls to the
displayMenuOption() method, testing both valid and invalid opt
values.
 • Ensure the Driver class correctly catches the exception which
is thrown from the displayMenuOption() method, and outputs a
message reporting the invalid option.
 Think you’re finished?  Check you have commented your code and added
Javadoc to the methods and classes. Also try to improve the
InvalidOptionException class so that it allows a message to be
included when it is thrown. Then use this message within the Driver
class to report the problem.

Programming Projects:
 1) Improving Code
  Start Eclipse and create a new Java project called ‘lab3’
  Download the associated Stats.java and Driver.java files (also
shown below)
  Add those two files to the project you have created, and
ensure you can execute the driver class. (output should be
shown in the console).
  Examine the program code, and improve it by doing the
following
1. Correct the indentation of both the Stats.java and
Driver.java class.
 2. Add Javadoc comments to the classes, attributes and methods
(remember to include @param and @return information).
 3. Add single line comments within the methods that have
anything other than a trivial line of code.
 4. Ensure the ‘public’ and ‘private’ modifiers are included
where appropriate.
 5. Change the names of any methods within the Stats.java class
which would make the purpose of the operation clearer
 6. Change the names of any variables that would make the code
easier to understand.

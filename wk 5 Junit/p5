Programming Projects:
 1) Testing a ‘simple’ Class
  Start Eclipse and create a new Java project called ‘lab4’
  Download the associated Triangle.java file (also shown below)
  Add the file to the project you have created.
  Create a separate JUnit5 test class and write individual tests
for all the methods of the Triangle.java class, including the
constructors. Give each test method a sensible name.
  Execute the tests to see whether they all pass.
  Your tests should reveal at least two bugs in the code. Fix
these so all your tests pass.
  Try to improve the tests by including some @RepeatedTest and
@ParameterizedTest methods to check multiple parameter values.
 Look again at the test for the setSides(int length, int other)
method. Can you write a test which shows the associated
comment to be inaccurate in some cases?
  Run the tests again using the “Coverage As” option from within
the Eclipse IDE, to ensure all methods have been exhaustedly
tested. i.e. have all possible branches of the isIsosceles(),
isEquilateral() and isScalene() been tested?
  Do your tests check what happens if negative length values are
passed to the constructors and methods? If not add these as
additional tests.
  Can you write a test that causes the (working version) of the
int getPerimeter() method to fail? If so can you suggest a way
to change the method so it will no longer fail
